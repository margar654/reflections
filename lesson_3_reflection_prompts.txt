When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   When I have several places for working. For example sometimes I am at home, 
   but other days I have to code at work or another place. Have the files in
   the cloud is a great advantage

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I prefer push and pull changes manually to keep the control of the files 
    I send to the remote repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches: Se trabaja en modo local. Se hace una reama para realizar
    modificaciones o cambios de la rama principal y concervar esta última

    Clones: copia de un repositirio. Clone puede ser en modo local-local
    o clonar remoto-local

    Fork: Copia de un repositorio en modo remoto-remoto. Es decir se copia 
    un repositorio de GitHub a tu cuenta de Git-Hub. Ambos repositorios quedan
    unidos, de modo que el original puede admitir tus cambios. Se puede tener 
    en local si realizamos un clone.
